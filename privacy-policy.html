      <h2>3. Gmail API Integration</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We use Google's Gmail API solely to enable teachers to send emails
          from their school email addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >We do not read, store, or analyze email content, subject lines, or
            message bodies.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>Email delivery is handled directly by Gmail's secure servers.</li>
        <li>
          We store only encrypted authentication tokens necessary for this
          functionality.
        </li>
        <li>Teachers maintain full control over their email communications.</li>
        <li>
          OAuth tokens are automatically deleted when users revoke access
          through their Google account settings.
