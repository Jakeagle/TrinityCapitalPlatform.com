    <p>Last Updated: 07/03/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By accessing and using our financial literacy application ("Trinity
      Capital"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If
      you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of the App</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed to provide financial literacy resources to students
      and educators. It includes lesson planning tools, email communication
      features, reporting tools, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Use of the App is limited to authorized school personnel, educators, and
      administrators who must be 18 years of age or older. When the App is used
      with students under 18, schools are responsible for obtaining any
      necessary parental consent and ensuring compliance with applicable laws
      regarding minors' data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments and Pricing</h2>
    <p>
      The App is offered as a one-time purchase with perpetual access. Current

      to increase the purchase price for new customers as we onboard additional
      schools, with the goal of reaching our target pricing tier. Existing
      customers who have already purchased access will not be subject to price
      increases and will retain their perpetual access rights.
